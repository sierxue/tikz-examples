## tikz-examples

This repository collects some tikz examples.

To demonstrate how these can be inserted into LaTeX documents,
each directory contains a file called directoryname.tex.
For example, in the Lattices directory is a file called Lattice.tex which pulls
in a bunch of lattices from that directory and surrounds them with a tikz
environment.
